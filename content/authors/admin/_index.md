José E. Diaz is a postdoctoral associate in the STAR Program and a trainee in the Translational Program of Health Disparities Research Training (TRANSPORT) at SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University. He is also a fellow in the Research Education Institute for Diverse Scholars (REIDS) program at Yale University. 

His research aims to advance our understanding of overlapping health disparities among Latine/x sexual minority adults, including HIV, substance use, and cardiovascular disease. He is leading a pilot study, recently funded by the Center for Drug Use and HIV/HCV Research at NYU, that examines how intersectional stigma and resilience are linked to past-year substance use treatment utilization among a nationwide sample of Latine/x sexual minority men who use stimulants (i.e., cocaine, methamphetamines). He is also collaborating on a NIDA-funded mHealth intervention to improve HIV care outcomes among sexual minority men living with HIV with moderate-to-severe stimulant use.
